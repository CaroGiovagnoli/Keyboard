# Guaraní keyboard layout
Guaraní-Spanish-Portuguese keyboard layout

The objective of this new proposal for keyboard distribution is to allow accessibility to the necessary signs to type guaraní and spanish.
Starting with the Spanish - ISO distribution and introducing the least amount of modifications possible we’ve introduced:

`y` + `´`

`e` `i` `u` `y` `g` + `~`

`saltillo` ⁄ `pusó`

`Gtilde` / `gtilde` -> They don’t have Unicode, but they can be typed using the combination accent.

`Saltillo` / `saltillo` -> They have Unicode. They’re a letters, so they can be typed directly and they’re inside the orbit of letters. They have lowercase and uppercase.

With this distribution we want to offer a solution for guaraní writing, independently of the font being used (any font that has combining accents should work).
It’s important to consider bilingual users because guaraní is a language that shares territory with other languages, mainly spanish and portuguese.

This distribution was created using Ukelele
